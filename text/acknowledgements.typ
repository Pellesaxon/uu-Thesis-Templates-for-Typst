Acknowledgements are not always necessary, only sometimes: if you have received significant help/feedback/support from someone (beyond what can be expected, e.g., from a supervisor), if you have received special permission to use some material or equipment, or if you have received financial sponsorship (which, for example, could affect scientific impartiality). The section should be brief and concise, typically one paragraph.
