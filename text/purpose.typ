Here you essentially describe your problem formulation. This section should state the purpose, goals, and motivation for the project. These do not need to be separate subheadings.

*Purpose:*
What is the project striving for? What is the overall goal, benefit, or effect of the project? (e.g., better health through dietary monitoring, easier planning of studies...)

*Goals:*
What specific deliverables or actions will the project accomplish to bring us closer to the purpose?

*Motivation:* 
Why is your project important? Who is it important for, and which external stakeholders are there? How significant is the problem, what are the consequences if it isn't solved, and how beneficial would it be to solve it? What "gap" in the field are you addressing? Why is your solution better/different than others'?

Avoid discussing your internal motivation, as it is rarely of interest to the reader.

Make sure to convince the reader in this section that the problem exists, that it isn't solved, and that it is important to solve. The stronger the argumentation and motivation (with sources), the better.

+ Show that there is a problem.
+ Show that the problem is important to solve and needs solving.
+ Show that the problem is not already solved.



In this section, you can also start describing ethical aspects and sustainability aspects, this could be in subsections.

== Delimitations

Here you describe what you have not done, i.e., how you have chosen to limit yourselves, and justify these limitations. This clarifies for the reader who may have had expectations you have not met.
