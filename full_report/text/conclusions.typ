Here you summarize and restate your contribution (the results of your project) and explain its significance and usage. What was important/new/interesting? (NOT in terms of what you learned, but for those reading the report)

Summarize the most important parts of the project, but not by copy-pasting; preferably with a new formulation. Try to place the most important parts in a larger perspective or context.
