Abstract, always in English, about 10-20 lines. Do not use references, and do not use formulas if they can be avoided.

    + What is the problem/issue/subject?
    + How was the problem solved/attacked?
    + What are the results, how well was the problem solved?
    + How good are the results, how useful are they?

The abstract should be understandable without reading the whole report (and the rest of the report should be understandable without reading the abstract). You can reuse text/phrases from the Introduction.
