Describe at least the same things as in the abstract, but in more detail --- typically 1-2 pages. Save technical details for later, as the reader is not yet familiar with them.

    + What is the area you are working in? What is the problem, subject, context?
    + Why is the problem important/interesting to solve?
    + How was the problem approached/solved?
    + What are the results, how well was the problem solved?
    + How good are the results, how useful are they?

Remember to start the introduction with a sentence or, even better, a whole paragraph that "captures" the reader and motivates them to keep reading. Starting with "We have chosen to do a project about X" might be relevant for you, but it won't make anyone want to read further. Try to include some background/context and (preferably) motivation to keep reading.

Make sure to get to the point quickly --- the reader doesn't want to go through two paragraphs of text before finding out what you plan to do in your project. For example, don't start by presenting all the ideas you didn't choose --- the reader wants to know what you are going to do, not what you are not going to do.

The introduction should be understandable to, for example, a student in the year below you, and preferably to an even broader audience.
Feel free to conclude with an overview of the entire report, briefly describing what the different sections are about. For example, @sec:purpose describes the purpose, aims and motivation. @sec:background outlines...
